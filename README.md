QuickSell Kanban Board Application
This Kanban board app, built with React JS, interacts with the API provided at [https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment]. It enables users to customize the board layout by grouping and sorting tasks based on their preferences. Users can group tickets by status, user, or priority, and sort them by priority or title. The app also saves the user's view settings, so they remain intact even after refreshing the page.
